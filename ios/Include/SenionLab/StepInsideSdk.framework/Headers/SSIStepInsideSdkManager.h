 This class is responsible for initializing the SDK and activating the resources used by the SDK.
 
 When calling the method `loadSdk`, it will initialize the SDK internally. 
 
 After `loadSdk` have been called, you can call any of the attach-methods depending on your need.
 
 - Note: You always need to keep a reference to this class to keep it alive. If this class gets deallocated, it will terminate the SDK. Also, you can only have one instance of this class at the same time.
